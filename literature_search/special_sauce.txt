RPE calculator - find maximum bar speed of a user, compute RPE based on percentage of max speed

is the user doing the lift correctly? - idea, compute difference between a "perfect" set and the user's set. DTW -> compute percentage difference? i don't actually think this would work. say we compare accelerometer time series data. the user could do a lift slower, and it could be totally alright, but the accelerometer would be different.

maybe we could track the bar path from rep to rep and ensure that it's consistent? that could pose some interesting challenges.
