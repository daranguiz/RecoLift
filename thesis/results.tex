\section{Methods}
Our accuracy can be characterized by three factors:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Segmentation}: Does the system properly detect \textit{when} a lift is being performed? Additionally, does the system ignore all idle motion?
    \item \textbf{Recognition}: Does the system properly determine \textit{which} lift is being performed?
    \item \textbf{Counting}: Does the system count the number of repetitions correctly?
\end{enumerate}

To test our system, we trained our classifiers on five lifts: low bar squat, overhead press, bench press, Pendlay row, and barbell curl. Testing comprised of performing 5 sets of each lift at 8 repetitions each, totaling 40 repetitions for each lift. An empty barbell weighing 45 lbs was used. 


\section{Final Results}
We achieved 100\% accuracy both on segmentation and recognition. Every set performed was noted and classified correctly, and no misclassification of idle movement occurred.
