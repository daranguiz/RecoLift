\documentclass[draftthesis,tocnosub,noragright,centerchapter,12pt]{uiucecethesis09}

% Use draftthesis for notes and date markings on every page.  Useful when you
%   have multiple copies floating around.
% Use offcenter for the extra .5 inch on the left side. Needed with fullpage and fancy.
% Use mixcasechap for compatibility with hyperref package, which does NOT like all caps default
% Use edeposit for the adviser/committee on the title page.
% Use tocnosub to suppress subsection and lower entries in the TOC.
% PhD candidates use "proquest" for the proquest abstract.
