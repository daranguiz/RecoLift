Despite the plethora of fitness trackers on the market, few monitor signals other than number of steps and heart rate. With the increasing mainstream acceptance of general-purpose smartwatches however, we have the capability to track more complex activities. We propose RecoLift, an Android-based system to track exercises and repetitions in weight training and bodyweight training activities based on the work of Morris et al. Our goal is to provide a system which provides feedback to the user in an autonomous, online fashion, harnessing both smartwatch and smartphone sensors. This system is separated into three key phases: \textit{segmentation}, during which we use the periodicity of the signals to determine if an exercise is being performed, \textit{recognition}, which calculates signal features to determine which exercise is being performed, and \textit{counting}, which uses periodicity to calculate the number of repetitions in a set. Early classification results show 94\% accuracy for our segmentation phase and 99\% accuracy for our recognition phase, with counting phase results within two repetitions on average.
