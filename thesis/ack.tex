I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Romit Roy Choudhury, for taking me under his wing and showing me how to break into the mobile space. Without his influence, this thesis would not have been possible.

I would also like to thank Dan Morris, T. Scott Saponas, Andrew Guillory, and Ilya Kelner for their outstanding paper which my thesis is based on. Their work enabled me to showcase the skills I have acquired over the duration of my undergraduate studies.

Finally, I would like to thank Kashev Dalmia for his continual support. Any time I needed a gym companion, he was always there to help.
