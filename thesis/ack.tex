I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Romit Roy Choudhury, for taking me under his wing and showing me how to break into the mobile space. Without his influence, this thesis would not have been possible.

I would also like to thank Morris et al. for their outstanding paper (REFERENCE) which my thesis is based on. Their work enabled me to showcase the skills I have acquired over the duration of my undergraduate studies.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for their continual support. When I grew weary or disheartened, I always had a friend to get me back on my feet.
