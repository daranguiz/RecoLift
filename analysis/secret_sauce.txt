secret sauce

------------------
Things I don't like about the paper:

repetitive intuition fails when lifter takes a really long time on a rep, ie at very high RPE and on a final repetition

features used for the signal recognition are context-agnostic. this might be good for very generalized tracking, but knowing our domain, I feel like we can do much better.


------------------
Thoughts for improvement:

aswin had the idea that slower reps might be a scaled version of another rep in terms of frequency. Is ther eanything i can do to work around that?

i would like to be able to generalize this so that additional exercises can be added, even if they're not in the corpus of training data, but this presents some problems with the second step, the recognition step.
